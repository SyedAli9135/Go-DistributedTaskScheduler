# Distributed Task Scheduler

## High-Level Architecture

The Distributed Task Scheduler consists of the following core components:

### 1. **Task Scheduler API**
   - Exposes REST/gRPC APIs for clients to create, list, and manage tasks.
   - Accepts task definitions, including metadata like execution time, retries, and parameters.

### 2. **Distributed State Management**
   - Maintains the global state of scheduled tasks using a distributed database (e.g., etcd, Consul, or Redis).
   - Ensures consistency and fault tolerance for task metadata and statuses.

### 3. **Task Worker Nodes**
   - Distributed workers that pick up tasks from the task queue and execute them.
   - Communicate with the state management system to update task statuses (e.g., running, completed, failed).
   - Support retries and exponential backoff for failed tasks.

### 4. **Leader Election**
   - A leader is elected among the instances of the Task Scheduler for coordinating task assignment and ensuring no duplication.
   - Uses a distributed consensus protocol (e.g., Raft via etcd) to manage leadership.

### 5. **Monitoring and Metrics**
   - Provides real-time observability into task processing with Prometheus and Grafana dashboards.
   - Tracks task throughput, worker health, and error rates.

## Workflow
1. **Client Interaction**:
   - A client submits a task via the Task Scheduler API.
   - The API validates and stores the task in the distributed state store.

2. **Leader Coordination**:
   - The leader node assigns tasks to available workers.

3. **Worker Execution**:
   - Workers poll tasks from the state store, execute them, and update their status.

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Metrics are collected and visualized for system health and task status.
